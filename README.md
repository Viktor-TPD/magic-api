### API MTG CARD SUGGESTER

This tool allows you to search for a random card out of Magic the Gathering's card pool by setting parameters
such as color, card type, card text and power/toughness.

# HOW DO I USE IT?

- Use the mana symbols to choose which color or color combination you'd like your card to be.

- Use the dropdown menu to pick type and text contained in the card. If you chose 'creature' as
  your type, you can also choose power and toughness.

- Hit the 'Get Random Card!' button to search for a card that fits the parameters you've set up.

# LIMITATIONS

- You can't find a card that doesn't exist - for example, there is no 0/6 WUBRG creature with Trample, Deathtouch
  and Lifelink. While the logic often catches this and sends you an error message, it is prone to unexpected
  behaviour.

- The tool can't display doublesided cards. This is the most common problem when a card doesn't load properly.
  Please refresh the page if this occurs.
